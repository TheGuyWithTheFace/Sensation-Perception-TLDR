# Princeton PSY345/NEU325: Sensation & Perception
### A TL;DR by Perry Cate '19

Disclaimer: I created this as my own study tool. I made aggressive, opinionated
(hopefully reasonable) choices about what to include.

(That said, suggestions, issues, and pull requests are always welcome!)


## Things not Included
 * Ways light can move (refraction, diffraction, etc)


## General Terms
 * **Perception**: Process for extracting info via the senses, forming internal
   representations of the world
 * **Percept**: How your brain represents something

## Philosophical stuff
 * **Epistemology**: Theory of knowledge. ("where's knowledge come from?")
    * **Psychological Nativism**: Mind creates ideas not from external sources
    * **Empiricism**: All knowledge comes from senses
      * Hobbes, Locke, Hume
      * Newborn is "blank slate" ("tabula rasa")
      * We believe this
 * **Metaphysics**: Theory of reality. ("What stuff is there in the world?")
    * **Dualism**: 2 kinds of stuff. Mind and matter.
      * Modern idea: little person inside our head that "percieves" what we see
    * **Monism**; Only one kind of stuff
      * All stuff is physical matter + energy (aka **materialism**)
        * Question is, how is conciousness a thing?
        * We believe this
      * Alternatively: Idealism (see below)
 * **Radical Skepticism**:
    * Rene Descartes (also fan of dualism)
    * Discard anything that can be doubted
    * Senses can be fooled (like The Matrix)
    * Only certain thing is that he exists. "I think, therefore I am" 

### Philosopy of mind
 * What's the relationship between the world and what's in our head?
    * **Naive Realism** (aka common sense realism)
       * We see the world perfectly as is
       * Wrong because illusions are a thing
    * **Idealism**
       * Only reality is our mind
       * No evidence in external world
       * Not testable or provable
    * **Representative Realism**: We percieve the world imperfectly through
      "sense data"
       * **Functionalism**: Understanding the function of sensory systems is
         all we need to "understand" them (thinking about algorithms)
       * We believe this

### Methods of Study (aka scientific approaches)
 * Ecological (phenomenological, naturalistic)
    * "Look at stuff, draw conclustions"
    * Gives better appreciation of evolutionary constraints, sensory behaviors
    * Lack of scientific rigor (stimulus control, self-report data)
 * Psychophysical
    * Carefully controlled lab stimuli
    * Carefully measured quantitative data
    * Very rigorous but stimuli different from what actually happens in nature
 * Neuropsysiological
    * Like psychophysics, but measuring neurological response to stuff
 * Modeling/Reverse Engineering
    * Use computers and robots to act like humans
    * Special models ("ideal observers") act as benchmarks


## Psychophysical Methods
 * Psychophysics = mind + matter
    * Founded by Gustav Fechner, father of experimental psychology
 * **Fechner's Law**: Sensation intensity is k\*log of stimulus intensity
 * **Weber's Law**: As stimulus increases, magnitude of change changes
   proportionately 
    * 1 lbs change in 20 lbs weight is as noticeable as .2 lbs change in 4 lbs
       weight
    * Derived from Fechner's Law
 * **Weber Fraction**: ratio of change magnitude / stimulus magnitude
   required to detect change 
    * Is the same regardless of stimulus size
 * **Steven's Power Law**: Sensation intensity = k * (magnitude of physical
   stimulus)^(constant that depends on stimulus)
    * Prof thinks this is less important than Weber-Fechner law
 * **Just-Noticeable Difference** (aka JND): Smallest magnitude change that can
   be detected
 * Measures of internal mental state
    * Detection (yes/no)
       * **Psychometric Function**: Relates physical quantity to probability of
         detecting something
    * Discrimination (x bigger than y)
    * Estimation (report stimulus exactly)
 * **Signal detection theory**: Quantifies response of observer to
   presentation of a signal when noise present
    * (signal=relevant, noise=irrelevant)
    * ie, Measures how good an observer is at observing
    * _hit_: Stimulus presented, observer thinks it was
    * _miss_: Stimulus presented, observer thinks it wasn't
    * _false alarm_: Stimulus not presented, observer thinks it was
    * _correct rejection_: Stimulus not presented, observer thinks it wasn't
    * **Noise distribution**: Values arising when stimulus not present
    * **Signal distribution**: Values arising when signal + noise present
    * **Type I Error**: Rate of false alarms or false positives
    * **Type II Error**: Rate of misses or false negatives
    * **D-prime** aka d': measure of sensitivity of observer
       * Higher d' -> more accurate observer 
    * **Psychometric Function**: Probability of observer _thinking_ they
    recognize stimulus as function of stimulus intensity as function of
    stimulus intensity


## Basic Neuroscience Stuff
 * **Frontal Lobe**: Attention, planning, short term memory, motivation
 * **Parietal Lobe**: Spatial sense, navigation, touch
    * Above temporal, behind frontal
 * **Occipital Lobe**: Vision (contains V1)
    * In the back of cerebellum
 * **Temporal Lobe**: Visual Memory, language comprehension, emotion
   association
    * At the bottom of cerebellum
 * **Neurons**: Make up nervous system
    * Axons connect to dendrites
    * Polarized membrane 
    * Sends spikes of current as signal through synapses by releasing
      neurotransmitters


## Vision
 * **Light**: EM radiation within narrow energy range, is both a wave and
   a particle
 * Optics (lenses) in eye force light from a single point in space to hit a
   single spot on the retina
    * Lets us form an image back there
 * Pinhole Camera: Small hole lets light through to make an image
    * Smaller hole=fewer rays -> sharper but dimmer image
 * **Cornea**: "Window" into eyeball, has 2/3 of eye's refractive power
 * **Aqueous humor**: Fluid behind cornea
 * **Lens**: Can change focus
 * **Pupil**: Opening at center of iris, light enters here
 * **Vitreous humor**: Gel fluid fills main eye cavity
 * **Retina**: Membrane on back of eye the detects light, has rods+cones
 * **Accommodation**: Lens changes shape to alter refractive power
 * **Emmetropia** No refractive power, looking at something in the distance so
   requires little effor to focus
 * **Myopia** aka Near-sightedness:
    * Lens too thicc/powerful
    * Eye too long
    * Image focuses before reaching retina
 * **Hyperopia** aka far-sightedness:
    * Lens too thin/not enough accomodation
    * Eye too short
    * Image would focus behind retina
 * **Astigmatism**: Vision defect due to unequal curving of refractive surfaces
 * **Visual Angle**: Size object takes up on retina (in degrees)

### How The Retina Works
 1. **Transduction**: Conversion of energy from one form to another 
    * This is important
    * **Phototransduction**: light into electricity (in retina)
       * **Rods**: Respond in low light (_"scotopic"_), don't process color 
       * **Cones**: 3 kinds, respond in daylight (_"photopic"_), process color
       * Not evenly distributed - cones mostly in center
       * We have way more rods than cones (90M vs 4-5M)
       * Rods and cones contain disks with **opsins**
          * Proteins that change shape when light absorbed
          * Different opsins respond to different wavelengths
             * **Rhodopsin**: opsin in rods (get it?)
       * Any molecule that is photosensitive is a _photopigment_
       * Rods+cones transmit signal constantly, stop when absorbing light (aka
         dark current)
 2. Processing
    * Amplification of weak signals
    * Compression of image so info can be sent to brain 
       * Optic Nerve is a bottleneck
 * Retina Layers: _(back to front)_
    1. Photoreceptors - detect light
    2. Bipolar Cells - transmits light data from photoreceptors to ganglions
    3. Ganglion Cells - recieves visual info via bipolar cells and amacrins,
       sends info to brain
 * Weird thing: Light has to pass through a bunch of stuff to reach
   photoreceptors (unlike cephalopods)
