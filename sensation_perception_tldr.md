# Princeton PSY345/NEU325: Sensation & Perception
### A TL;DR by Perry Cate '19

Disclaimer: I created this as my own study tool. I made aggressive, opinionated
(hopefully reasonable) choices about what to include.

(That said, suggestions, issues, and pull requests are always welcome!)


## Things not Included
 * Ways light can move (refraction, diffraction, etc)


## General Terms
 * **Perception**: Process for extracting info via the senses, forming internal
   representations of the world
 * **Percept**: How your brain represents something

## Philosophical stuff
 * **Epistemology**: Theory of knowledge. ("where's knowledge come from?")
    * **Psychological Nativism**: Mind creates ideas not from external sources
    * **Empiricism**: All knowledge comes from senses
      * Hobbes, Locke, Hume
      * Newborn is "blank slate" ("tabula rasa")
      * We believe this
 * **Metaphysics**: Theory of reality. ("What stuff is there in the world?")
    * **Dualism**: 2 kinds of stuff. Mind and matter.
      * Modern idea: little person inside our head that "percieves" what we see
    * **Monism**; Only one kind of stuff
      * All stuff is physical matter + energy (aka **materialism**)
        * Question is, how is conciousness a thing?
        * We believe this
      * Alternatively: Idealism (see below)
 * **Radical Skepticism**:
    * Rene Descartes (also fan of dualism)
    * Discard anything that can be doubted
    * Senses can be fooled (like The Matrix)
    * Only certain thing is that he exists. "I think, therefore I am" 

### Philosopy of mind
 * What's the relationship between the world and what's in our head?
    * **Naive Realism** (aka common sense realism)
       * We see the world perfectly as is
       * Wrong because illusions are a thing
    * **Idealism**
       * Only reality is our mind
       * No evidence in external world
       * Not testable or provable
    * **Representative Realism**: We percieve the world imperfectly through
      "sense data"
       * **Functionalism**: Understanding the function of sensory systems is
         all we need to "understand" them (thinking about algorithms)
       * We believe this

### Methods of Study (aka scientific approaches)
 * Ecological (phenomenological, naturalistic)
    * "Look at stuff, draw conclustions"
    * Gives better appreciation of evolutionary constraints, sensory behaviors
    * Lack of scientific rigor (stimulus control, self-report data)
 * Psychophysical
    * Carefully controlled lab stimuli
    * Carefully measured quantitative data
    * Very rigorous but stimuli different from what actually happens in nature
 * Neuropsysiological
    * Like psychophysics, but measuring neurological response to stuff
 * Modeling/Reverse Engineering
    * Use computers and robots to act like humans
    * Special models ("ideal observers") act as benchmarks


## Psychophysical Methods
 * Psychophysics = mind + matter
    * Founded by Gustav Fechner, father of experimental psychology
 * **Fechner's Law**: Sensation intensity is k\*log of stimulus intensity
 * **Weber's Law**: As stimulus increases, magnitude of change changes
   proportionately 
    * 1 lbs change in 20 lbs weight is as noticeable as .2 lbs change in 4 lbs
       weight
    * Derived from Fechner's Law
 * **Weber Fraction**: ratio of change magnitude / stimulus magnitude
   required to detect change 
    * Is the same regardless of stimulus size
 * **Steven's Power Law**: Sensation intensity = k * (magnitude of physical
   stimulus)^(constant that depends on stimulus)
    * Prof thinks this is less important than Weber-Fechner law
 * **Just-Noticeable Difference** (aka JND): Smallest magnitude change that can
   be detected
 * Measures of internal mental state
    * Detection (yes/no)
       * **Psychometric Function**: Relates physical quantity to probability of
         detecting something
    * Discrimination (x bigger than y)
    * Estimation (report stimulus exactly)
 * **Signal detection theory**: Quantifies response of observer to
   presentation of a signal when noise present
    * (signal=relevant, noise=irrelevant)
    * ie, Measures how good an observer is at observing
    * _hit_: Stimulus presented, observer thinks it was
    * _miss_: Stimulus presented, observer thinks it wasn't
    * _false alarm_: Stimulus not presented, observer thinks it was
    * _correct rejection_: Stimulus not presented, observer thinks it wasn't
    * **Noise distribution**: Values arising when stimulus not present
    * **Signal distribution**: Values arising when signal + noise present
    * **Type I Error**: Rate of false alarms or false positives
    * **Type II Error**: Rate of misses or false negatives
    * **D-prime** aka d': measure of sensitivity of observer
       * Higher d' -> more accurate observer 
    * **Psychometric Function**: Probability of observer _thinking_ they
    recognize stimulus as function of stimulus intensity as function of
    stimulus intensity


## Basic Neuroscience Stuff
 * **Frontal Lobe**: Attention, planning, short term memory, motivation
 * **Parietal Lobe**: Spatial sense, navigation, touch
    * Above temporal, behind frontal
 * **Occipital Lobe**: Vision (contains V1)
    * In the back of cerebellum
 * **Temporal Lobe**: Visual Memory, language comprehension, emotion
   association
    * At the bottom of cerebellum
 * **Neurons**: Make up nervous system
    * Axons connect to dendrites
    * Polarized membrane 
    * Sends spikes of current as signal through synapses by releasing
      neurotransmitters


## Vision
 * **Light**: EM radiation within narrow energy range, is both a wave and
   a particle
 * Optics (lenses) in eye force light from a single point in space to hit a
   single spot on the retina
    * Lets us form an image back there
 * Pinhole Camera: Small hole lets light through to make an image
    * Smaller hole=fewer rays -> sharper but dimmer image
 * **Cornea**: "Window" into eyeball, has 2/3 of eye's refractive power
 * **Aqueous humor**: Fluid behind cornea
 * **Lens**: Can change focus
 * **Pupil**: Opening at center of iris, light enters here
 * **Vitreous humor**: Gel fluid fills main eye cavity
 * **Retina**: Membrane on back of eye the detects light, has rods+cones
 * **Accommodation**: Lens changes shape to alter refractive power
 * **Emmetropia** No refractive power, looking at something in the distance so
   requires little effor to focus
 * **Myopia** aka Near-sightedness:
    * Lens too thicc/powerful
    * Eye too long
    * Image focuses before reaching retina
 * **Hyperopia** aka far-sightedness:
    * Lens too thin/not enough accomodation
    * Eye too short
    * Image would focus behind retina
 * **Astigmatism**: Vision defect due to unequal curving of refractive surfaces
 * **Visual Angle**: Size object takes up on retina (in degrees)

### How The Retina Works
 1. **Transduction**: Conversion of energy from one form to another 
    * This is important
    * **Phototransduction**: light into electricity (in retina)
       * **Rods**: Respond in low light (_"scotopic"_), don't process color 
       * **Cones**: 3 kinds, respond in daylight (_"photopic"_), process color
       * Not evenly distributed - cones mostly in center
       * We have way more rods than cones (90M vs 4-5M)
       * Rods and cones contain disks with **opsins**
          * Proteins that change shape when light absorbed
          * Different opsins respond to different wavelengths
             * **Rhodopsin**: opsin in rods (get it?)
       * Any molecule that is photosensitive is a _photopigment_
       * Rods+cones transmit signal constantly, stop when absorbing light (aka
         dark current)
 2. Processing
    * Amplification of weak signals
    * Compression of image so info can be sent to brain 
       * Optic Nerve is a bottleneck
 * Retina Layers: _(back to front)_
    1. Photoreceptors - detect light
    2. Bipolar Cells - transmits light data from photoreceptors to ganglions
    3. Ganglion Cells - recieves visual info via bipolar cells and amacrins,
       sends info to brain
       * On-center, off-surround - Responds to light in center, dark outside
       * Off-center, on-surround - Responds to dark center, light outside
       * ^Both emphasize edges and outlines in vision
       * **Receptive Field**: "what makes a neuron fire"
          * Function neuron uses to add up inputs
          * `light level * center weight + light level * surround weight =
            spike`
       * Both ON and OFF ganglions have 2 types:
          * **Parvocellular**: "small", processes shape, color
          * **Magnocellular**: "big", processes motion
 * Weird thing: Light has to pass through a bunch of stuff to reach
   photoreceptors (unlike cephalopods)
 * **Luminance Adaptation**: Adapting to different light levels
    * Humans can adapt to 6 orders of magnitude light difference (!!!)
    * 2 Mechanisms:
       * Pupil dialation
          * Pupil gets bigger or smaller (2mm vs 8mm, 16x more light)
       * Photoreceptor pigment levels
          * More light -> photopigment gets "used up"
             * less available phtopigment=retina is less sensitive
    * Don't need to estimate light level, just need to see objects
       * Rely on _contrast_, differences in light
       * C = difference in light level / overall light level
       * Better for retina to send info about local differences in light

### Eye-Brain Things
 1. Signals go from eyes to brain through optic nerve
 2. Nerves cross at optic _chiasm_
 3. **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)** (in the thalamus)
    * One on each side of brain
    * Represents vis. field
    * Has eye-specific layers
    * has M and P layers
    * **Ipsilateral**: Same side of body
    * **Contralateral**: Opposite side of body
    * Responds to one eye or the other, _never both_
 4. **Primary Visual Cortex (V1)** (aka Striate cortex)
    * Everything else: "pre-cortical"
    * First place in cortex where vis. info actually processed
    * Responds to _both eyes_
        * But neurons prefer one eye or the other (aka okular dominance)
    * Circular receptive fields (like Ganglions) replaced by stripe receptive
      fields
        * Respond to bars in specific orientations or moving lines
        * **Simple Cells**: Prefer light or dark bars
        * **Complex Cells**: Respond to light or dark
    * Vertical arrangements of neurons (aka columns)
        * Columns in cortex have same:
           * Preferred dominant eye
           * Preferred Orientation
        * **Hypercolumn**: 1mm block, has everything needed to see certain
          small part of world
           * Every possible orientation
           * Left and right eyes
 * **Acuity**: Finest Visual detail that can be registered
    * _Snelen E test_: uses grating of strokes on capital E.
    * Eye doctors: use letters to measure your distance/avg person's distance
      (20/20, etc.)
    * Vision scientists: visual angle of 1 cycle (light/dark pattern) of finest
      grating you can see
    * **Spacial Frequency**: # bars per unit length
    * **Fourier Decomposition**:
       * V1 breaks images into sum of sine waves
       * Strongest response from ganglion cells when peaks/troughs line up with
         on-center, off-surround (or vice versa)
 * **Topography**: Mapping of objects in space onto V1 
    * Is contralateral, so each field repped in opposite hemisphere
 * **Cortical Magnification**: V1 gives more attention to center of field
   (fovea)
    * Misnomer because magnification already happens in retina
 * **Adaptation**: Response diminishes to sustained stimulus
    * Can "knock-out" groups of neurons by activating strongly
    * Can adapt to spatial frequency

### Beyond V1: Object Vision
 * Identifying objects
 * No one knows how this works
 * **View-dependent model**: Only recognizes particular views of an object
   (house from the front, etc.)
    * Not enough neurons for every possible view
    * Doesn't work
 * **Middle Vision**: After basic features extracted, before object
   recognition
    * Edges and surfaces
    * Determines grouping of regions into objects
    * "Edge detection" (and Fourier Analysis) are FAILING theories of what V1
      does.  Sad!
    * **Illusory contour**: Contour percieved even though no edge present
    * **Structuralism**: Perception built up from "atoms" of sensation (color,
      orientation, etc.) - doesn't fit because of things like illusory contours
    * **Gestalt psychology**: Whole is greater than sum of parts
       * **Gestalt Grouping**: Set of rules for when elements in image appear
         to group together
          * Based on _similarity_ and _proximity_
          * _Good continuation_: Elements group if they're on the same contour
          * Dynamic grouping
             * _Common fate_: Elements group if moving in same direction
             * _Synchrony_: Elements group if changing at the same time
          * Ground assignment
             * _Surroundedness_: Surrounded region likely to be ground
             * _Size_: Smaller region likely to be figure
             * _Symmetry_: Symmetrical region likely figure
             * _Parallelism_: Regions with || contours likely figure
             * _Extremal Edges_: If edges are shaded such that they seem to
               recede, likely figure.
       * Accidental viewpoint: Regularty in visual image not present in real
         world
          * Visual System _doesn't_ accept interpretations that assume
            accidental viewpoints
          * Opposite (non-accidental viewpoint): Interpretation doesn't change
            if you move the camera a bit
 * Object recognition not entirely viewpoint invariant
    * Faces harder to recognize when inverted
    * The more something is rotated, the harder it is to recognize
 * Facts contstraining object recognition models:
    1. Visual processing happens in 2 streams (after V1)
       * What vs Where info
    2. Object recognition is _fast_
       * Suggests **Feed-forward process**
          * Computation carried out 1 step after another
          * No need for feedback from later stage
 * Object Recognition Models
    * **Pandemonium model**
       * Perceptual "committee" of "demons" (neurons)
       * Each level a different brain area
          * Decision demon, cognitive demons, feature demons
          * Each demon is a possible letter, edge, etc.
    * **Hierarchical "constructive" models**
       * Explicit structure of how parts are combined to form image as whole
       * Committees with specialized members

### Color Vision
 * Lack of color vision != black+white
 * Psychophysical property, not physical
 * **Spectral**: Referring to wavelength
 * **Illuminant**: Light source
 * **Power Spectrum**: Curve of energy at each frequency of light
    * Red things have high energy values at longer (red) wavelengths, etc.
 * **Absorbtion Spectrum**: Response (aka light absorbtion) of photoreceptor as
   function of wavelength
 * 3 Cone classes
    * _S_ - Short (blue)
    * _M_ - Medium (green)
    * _L_ - Long (Red)
 * **Univariance**: Infinite set of wavelength+intensity combinations can get
   same respont from S, M, and L cones
    * **Metamers**: Illuminants physically distinct, perceptually the same
    * This is how display LEDs work
 * **Color Space**: 3D space describing all color percepts
    * RGB: Outputs of Long, Medium, Short wavelengths
    * HSB: Hue, Saturation, and Brightness
 * **Newton's Spectrum**:
    * ROY G BIV
    * He thought 7 kinds of light -> 7 kinds of receptors
 * **Opponent color theory**:
    * Perception based on output of 3 channels
    * Each channel based on opponency between 2 colors
       * Some Ganglion Cells have fields with color opponency (instead of rod
         black vs white)
          * Red-Green (L-M) (L center, M surround)
          * Red-Green (M-L) (M center, L surround
          * Blue-Yellow (S-(M+L)) (S center, L and M surround)
 * **Afterimage** (aka negative): Image seen after stimulus removed
    * Opposite of original stimulus (complementary)
 * **Color Constancy**: Tendency of surface to appear same color despite wide
   range of illuminants
    * Keeps daylight vs candles, types of lightbulbs, etc. from changing color
      of surroundings too much
    * Caused "the dress" incident
       * From precept: white+black vs blue+gold depended on what time of day
         viewer thought it was
 * **Color mixing**
    * _Additive_: Mixing of lights
       * 2 lights arrive at eye -> effects are added
    * _subtractive_: Mixing of paints
       * 2 pigments mix, light shining on surface subtracted by both A and B,
         so only the difference is reflected
       * Alt. Example: Light through multiple filters
 * **Color blindness**
    * **Dichromat**: Can only see 2 colors
       * 3 types:
          * **Protanopia**: Absence of L-cones
          * **Deuteranopia**: Absence of M-cones (most common)
          * **Tritanopia**: Absence of S-cones (least common)
    * **Monochromat**: True color blindness, world is black and white
    * **Cone Monochromat**: Only have one cone type (true b/w)
    * **Rod Monochromat**: World is black/white AND impaired in bright light
